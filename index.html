                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education can be characterized from the teacher's or the student's
                    perspective. Teacher-centered definitions focus on the perspective and role of the teacher. They may
                    claim, for example, that education is the transmission of knowledge and skills in a morally
                    appropriate way.[26][2][9] Student-centered definitions, on the other hand, see education from the
                    student's experience in the learning process. For example, they may define it as a process that
                    transforms and enriches their subsequent experience.[27][10][28] Definitions taking both
                    perspectives into account are also possible. This can take the form of describing the process as the
                    shared experience of a common world. This shared experience involves discovery as well as posing and
                    solving problems.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education socializes children into society by teaching cultural
                    values and norms. It equips them with the skills needed to become productive members of society.
                    This way, it stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized
                    institutions affect many aspects of education. For example, governments set education policies. They
                    determine when school classes happen, what is taught, and who can or must attend. International
                    organizations, like UNESCO, have been influential in promoting primary education for all children.

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The main field investigating education is called education studies.
                    It examines what education is and what aims it has. It also studies how it happens, what effects it
                    has, and how to improve it. It has many subfields, like philosophy of education, psychology of
                    education, sociology of education, economics of education, and comparative education. It also
                    discusses the history of education. In pre-history, education happened informally through oral
                    communication and imitation. With the rise of ancient civilizations, writing was invented and the
                    amount of knowledge grew. This caused a shift from informal to formal education. Initially, formal
                    education was mainly available to elites and religious groups. The invention of the printing press
                    in the 15th century made books more widely available. This increased general literacy. Beginning in
                    the 18th and 19th centuries, public education became more important. It led to the worldwide process
                    of making primary education available to all, free of charge, and compulsory up to a certain age.
